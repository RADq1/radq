  const text = "I am RadosÅ‚aw Gackowski, my first hobby has always been computer science and I started my journey with computers when i was 6 years old. First of all i learned how to play games, next when i grew up I started to create some servers in games like Counter-Strike (casual and with modes like Zombie Mod, CoD MoD, BaseBuilder) and Minecraft (Survival, Hunger Games), so i have a little experience with modyfing scripts for these games in C# and Java programming languages. I graduated from Politechnika Bydgoska with Bachelor of Engineering Degree, i studied applied computer science. I've been learning JavaScript, React for at least 1 year. I had finished a graduation project with these technologies and now I'm still learning new libraries for React. "
